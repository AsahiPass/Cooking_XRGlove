üç≥ MAMN60 Augmented Reality COOKING TUTORIAL
Project Overview
This project was developed as a mandatory part of the MAMN60 Augmented Reality - Interaction course at Lund University (LTH).

The goal of this project is to create an Augmented Reality (AR) cooking assistant application that provides users with real-time, immersive, and hands-free guidance in the kitchen, making complex recipes easier to follow and execute accurately.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-time AR Overlays: Superimposes recipe steps, timers, and visual cues directly onto the physical cooking environment.

Object Recognition: Utilizes Computer Vision to identify key ingredients, utensils, and tools (e.g., detecting a tomato, knife, or cutting board) to provide contextual help.

Step Tracking and Validation: The system attempts to automatically advance the recipe or provide error feedback by observing the user's actions.

Hands-Free Interaction: Implements gesture control (or voice commands) to navigate between recipe steps without touching the device.
